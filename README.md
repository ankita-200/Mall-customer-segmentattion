# Mall-customer-segmentattion
This project focuses on analyzing mall customer data to identify distinct customer segments based on their shopping behavior and demographic attributes. By applying clustering techniques such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, or DBSCAN, the goal is to group customers into segments with similar characteristics. 

#Objectives
Segment customers based on age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

Identify high-value and low-value customer clusters.

Visualize patterns to support data-driven marketing decisions.

# Key Steps
1. Data Collection – Import mall customer dataset (CSV file).

2. Data Cleaning – Handle missing values and ensure data consistency.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize distributions and relationships using plots.

4. Feature Selection – Choose relevant attributes for clustering.

5. Modeling – Apply K-Means Clustering to group customers.

6. Visualization – Plot customer clusters using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
